Going up, toppling the ruling class, improving the lives of those below, not enough resources/space to go around?
End - bring people up from walls to the plateau / stop the flow of smog and climb down?

Start to investigate, enter mines, hear of someone who knows something, save them, climb levels, chased down, hide, hear that smog comes from a pipe hided in the smog, investigate, climb back up, sneak through capital, fight tough guys, climb through treacherous, booby trapped, guarded industrial/ shield area. Defeat people on top of plateau.
