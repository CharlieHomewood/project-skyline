Life hanging off a cliff. Very tall sheer mountain spire. Monsters live in caves in the mountain. Plateau on top with greenery. Resources in mountain. Toxic smog below the mountain preventing descent. Pipes and cladding shallowly in the cliff preventing most mining except for the mine entrances.

Almost steampunk/ teslapunk but toned down. Certain tech is reliant of magic powers
