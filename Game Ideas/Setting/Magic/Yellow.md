Originally this colour of magic has the passive effect of increasing a persons intelligence and memory. However for the purposes of a video game that doesn't have much utility so perhaps it could instead be a foresight ability?
It can be the first ability gained and it allows the character to 'respawn' and 'load'. no extra game function but lore wise whenever the character dies it was actually just a premonition. the first time it happens it could have a short animation/cut scene.
