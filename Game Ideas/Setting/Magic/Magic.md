The magic system is based around radiation. The people with magic emit a specific radiation that causes their effect. External effects created through this radiation also emit their own which is detectable with a machine. 

There is a chemical called Chylino in the rain that emits a ==C-Wave radiation==<!--Aren't C-waves related to seismic activity, rather than radiation?
-----
There are a few types of C-Waves in real life such as in cardiology. Since this is fiction I don't mind the overlap.-->that interferes with and breaks down all magical radiation. 

Power dampeners exits that constantly trigger Chylino to emit C-Waves and prevent all external magic use. In places where magic is required/ allowed, they instead have sprinklers to block powers only when activated.
