## What is QuickAdd?

QuickAdd is a [[Community Plugins|community plugin]] which allows you to automate certain tasks inside an Obsidian vault. There are four types of automation tasks that QuickAdd provides, referred to as `choices`.

## QuickAdd Choices
### Template

Templates will create a new note with a specified template. 

> [!example] An example...
> We have a QuickAdd choice for a `Meeting` template
> 
> When this is selected, this choice will create a new meeting note for the current day (assuming one does not already exist).

### Capture

Captures allow you to quickly add content to a note without actually opening that note and writing anything down/clicking anything on the note.

> [!example] An example...
> We have an `Add Task to Backlog` capture choice. 
> 
> Selecting this choice opens a text box where you can name a new task. 
> 
> Upon clicking `ok`, this will automatically be added to the `Backlog` column in the `Task Progress Review` Kanban board - no need to open it and add the task manually!

### Macro

Macros allow you to execute any sequence of Obsidian commands and/or custom user scripts. 

This choice is both extremely powerful and difficult to use, most often requiring some knowledge of JavaScript.

### Multi

This choice simply functions as a folder to store other choices inside of, making it easier to organise and navigate the QuickAdd menu.

> [!example] An example...
> We have a multi choice called `ðŸ“‹ Create a New Note`.
> 
> This simply stores different categories of note templates to choose from in the QuickAdd menu.
