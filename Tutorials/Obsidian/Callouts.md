## How to Create Callouts

To create a callout, we create `identifiers`. [[Callouts#Types of Callouts|See the Types of Callouts section]] for all available identifiers.

On a blank line just type ` > [!{an identifier}]` For example:

Typing this: \> [!info]

Creates:
 > [!info]

To add a custom title to the callout, just add that title immediately after the callout identifier. For example:

Typing this: \ > [!info] This is a Custom Title

Creates:
 > [!info] This is a Custom Title
