 > [!note] Intro
 > Callouts are a way to insert additional content into a note in the form of a coloured textbox. This is a nice way to highlight a particular piece of information or visually mark some content as separated from the rest of the note.

 > This text box itself is an example of a \!\[note\] callout

## How to Create Callouts

To create a callout, we create `identifiers`. [[Callouts#Types of Callouts|See the Types of Callouts section]] for all available identifiers.

On a blank line just type ` > [!{an identifier}]` For example:

Typing this: \> \[!info\]

Creates:
 > [!info]

To add a custom title to the callout, just add that title immediately after the callout identifier. For example:

Typing this: > \[!info\] This is a Custom Title

Creates:
 > [!info] This is a Custom Title
