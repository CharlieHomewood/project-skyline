## Internal Links

Internal links are a way to create hyperlink between notes inside an Obsidian vault.

To create a link, use: \[\[]]
 - This will automatically open a dropdown menu where you can select or type the name of the note you wish to link to

You can customise the text of a link by using the `|` separator.

 > [!example]
 > Let's say you wanted to link to the note `Hello` . You could rename the link so that it fitted in with your writing more fluently.
 > 

These links are more specifically called **outgoing links**, as they link **outwards** to another note. If a note is linked to by some other note, it will have an implicit **backlink**. 

 > [!tip]
 > You can access a note's outgoing and backward links in the right-hand sidebar:
 >  - The outgoing links are under the ![|25](https://i.imgur.com/vxRVdfa.png) tab
 >  - The backward links are under the ![|25](https://i.imgur.com/wSD0rSm.png) tab

Holding CTRL whilst hovering over a link will open that link's content inside a pop-out window. This can be useful for quickly seeing its content. You can even edit the note inside this pop-out window to some extent, such as checking or unchecking tasks.

 > [!example] Example
 >  - Press `CTRL` and hover over [[My Dashboard|this link]]
 >  - You should be able to see the contents of your `My Dashboard` note
 >  - Bonus: inside that pop-out window, `CTRL` and hover over one of your task links

### Linking to Subsections

Rather than linking to an entire note, you can more specifically target your link to a subsection of a note. To do this, you can reference the heading in the note you wish to link to.

To do this, just add "#" to the end of the note's name inside the link and then type the name of the header you want to link to. 

 > [!example] Example
 >  - Typing \[\[Hello#World]] will link to the `# World` header inside the `Hello` note
