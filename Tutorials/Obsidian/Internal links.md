## Internal Links

Internal links are a way to create hyperlink between notes inside an Obsidian vault.

To create a link, use: \[\[]]
 - This will automatically open a dropdown menu where you can select or type the name of the note you wish to link to

These links are more specifically called **Outgoing links**, as they link **outwards** to another note. If a note is linked to by some other note, it will have an implicit **backlink**. 

 > [!tip]
 > You can access a note's outgoing and backward links in the right-hand sidebar:
 >  - The outgoing links are under the ![|25](https://i.imgur.com/vxRVdfa.png) tab
 >  - The backward links are under the ![|25](https://i.imgur.com/wSD0rSm.png) tab
### Linking to Subsections

Rather than linking to an entire note, you can more specifically target your link to a subsection of a note. To do this, you can reference the heading in the note you wish to link to.

To do this, just add "#" to the end of the note's name inside the link and then type the name of the header you want to link to. 

 > [!example] An Example
 >  - Typing \[\[Hello#World]] will link to the `# World` header inside the `Hello` note
