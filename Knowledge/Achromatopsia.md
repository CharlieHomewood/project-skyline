## Definition

The inability to perceive colours

## Symptoms

1. Colour blindness (Monochromacy)
2. Poor clarity of vision (uncorrectable with lenses)
3. Sensitivity to bright light
4. Shaking eyes ([[Nystagmus]])
	1. High frequency, low amplitude horizontal shaking

## Genetic Causes

Six genes account for over 90% of ACHM cases - [Brunetti-Pierri  et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7914547/#sec3-ijms-22-01681:~:text=Pathogenic%20variants%20in,cases%20%5B19%5D.)

 > "Pathogenic variants in six genes encoding components of the cone phototransduction cascade (CNGA3, CNGB3, PDE6C, PDE6H, GNAT2) and of the unfolded protein response (ATF6) have been implicated in ACHM. Collectively, these genes account for over 90% of ACHM cases, while CNGA3 and CNGB3 alone are responsible for 69% of cases."

## Prevalence

1 in 30,000-50,000
