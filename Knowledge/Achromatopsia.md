## Definition

Rare genetic disorder which results in the inability to perceive some or all colours

## Symptoms

All symptoms develop from birth

 - Colour blindness (Monochromacy)
 - Poor visual acuity (unclear vision) 
	 - Uncorrectable with glasses
 - [[Eccentric fixation]]
	 - Having a point on the retina other than the fovea which is the point of focus 
	 - Typically, the fovea is the point of focus. It is situated in the centre of the retina and it is where vision is clearest
 - Sensitivity to bright light ([[Photophobia]])
	 - **Not fear of bright light**
 - Shaking eyes ([[Nystagmus]]) 
	 - High frequency, low amplitude horizontal shaking

## Genetic Causes

Six genes account for over 90% of ACHM cases - [Brunetti-Pierri  et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7914547/#sec3-ijms-22-01681:~:text=Pathogenic%20variants%20in,cases%20%5B19%5D.)

 > "Pathogenic variants in six genes encoding components of the cone phototransduction cascade (CNGA3, CNGB3, PDE6C, PDE6H, GNAT2) and of the unfolded protein response (ATF6) have been implicated in ACHM. Collectively, these genes account for over 90% of ACHM cases, while CNGA3 and CNGB3 alone are responsible for 69% of cases."

## Prevalence

1 in 30,000-50,000 [Sharpe et al. (1999) p. 50](https://www.academia.edu/90334994/Opsin_genes_cone_photopigments_color_vision_and_color_blindness#loswp-work-container)
